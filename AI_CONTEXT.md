# AI Context

Status: Stable  
Last Reviewed: 2026-02-28

Purpose: Provide consistent context to AI tools about identity, naming, and engineering practices.

---

## Identity

Primary engineering identity: TinMan  
Real/legal identity: George Gil

Public authorship should default to TinMan unless explicitly personal/legal.

---

## Naming Tiers

Use `usernames.md` as source of truth.

Choose identity first:

- TinMan ladder for engineering/public technical authorship.
- TinkerSpace ladder for studio/environment/workspace contexts.

Then apply sequential fallback within that ladder only.
Avoid unrelated suffixes.

---

## Repository Standards

Follow:

- project-standards.md for repo structure
- naming.md for naming
- coding.md for engineering conventions

---

## Technology Orientation

Primary domains:

- Systems programming
- Robotics
- Platform engineering
- Graphics/rendering
- Backend systems
- Cross-platform apps
- Mechanical prototyping

AI suggestions should align with modular, layered architecture.

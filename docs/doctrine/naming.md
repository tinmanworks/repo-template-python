## Scope

Applies to repositories, code, modules, and project naming.

## General Principles

- Names must be intentional.
- Avoid randomness.
- Avoid numbers unless technically required.
- Prefer clarity over cleverness.
- Avoid mixing identity layers in names.

---

## Repository Naming

- Use lowercase.
- Use kebab-case.
- Keep names short and meaningful.
- Avoid vague names.

Examples:
tinman-portfolio
frmakekit-engine
trenex-runtime

---

## Class Naming (C++)

- Use PascalCase.
- Clear semantic meaning.
- Avoid unnecessary abbreviations.

Examples:
SessionManager
NodeGraph
SharedMemoryPort

---

## Variables

- Use camelCase.
- Descriptive but concise.
- Avoid single-letter variables except loops.

---

## Studio / Space Naming

- Use TinkerSpace only for environments.
- Do not combine TinMan and TinkerSpace in the same naming scope.

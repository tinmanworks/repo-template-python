# Identity Structure

Status: Draft  
Last Reviewed: 2026-02-27

## Scope

Defines how identity layers are used across platforms, projects, accounts, environments, and digital infrastructure.

## Overview

Three identity layers exist with distinct responsibilities.
They represent role separation, not different personas.

## George Gil

Used for:
- Legal matters
- University / academic systems
- Employment / contracts
- Financial accounts
- Government services
- Personal infrastructure accounts
- Social life platforms
- Official registrations
- Account ownership where legal identity matters

Personal infrastructure includes:
- Apple ID
- Google personal account
- Microsoft personal account
- Streaming services
- Banking
- Insurance
- Shopping platforms
- Cloud storage accounts
- Domain ownership
- GitHub account ownership/login

Rule:
If the platform represents the real person legally, financially, personally, or for long-term account ownership/security, use George Gil.

## TinMan

Used for:
- Software authorship
- GitHub and development platforms
- Engineering discussions
- Technical communities
- Package authorship
- Commit authorship
- Technical branding
- Public engineering presence

Rule:
If the context represents engineering output or technical authorship, use TinMan.

Notes:
- GitHub public identity uses TinMan.
- Git commit identity uses TinMan.
- Account ownership may still belong to George Gil internally.

---

## TinkerSpace

Used for:
- Creative environments
- Studio-like systems
- Home automation naming for TinkerSpace-related physical spaces
- Workshop naming
- Content creation spaces
- Project ecosystems

Rule:
If referring to a space, environment, or studio context, use TinkerSpace.

## Email Usage

Private email:
- Personal infrastructure
- Account ownership
- Security and recovery
- Financial/legal services
- GitHub account login

Public email:
- Developer/public contact
- Open source contact
- Technical communication

Commit email:
- Prefer GitHub noreply
- Otherwise public developer email
- Never private email

---

## Separation Rule

Do not mix identity layers unnecessarily.

Each platform must clearly map to one primary identity layer,
even if legal ownership differs internally.
